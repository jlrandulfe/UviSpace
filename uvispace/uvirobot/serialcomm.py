"""
This module contains the class SerMesProtocol().

The aim is to provide a set of methods for performing communication 
operations with an external device, using a pair of XBee modules
(IEEE 802.15.4 protocol). Needless to say, the modules have to be 
previously configured for being able to communicate with each other, and
that task is out of the scope of this module.

The aforementioned class' methods build up messages following a common 
structure and send them through serial port to a slave with the same
implemented protocol.

Moreover, it offers methods specific to the UGV operation, as the *move*
method, that takes a speeds setpoints inputs and sends them correctly 
formatted to the slave.

    This is a child of PySerial class and implements a comm. protocol.
    
    This class implements a message-based protocol over the serial port
    in Master-slave mode: The master (PC) starts communication with 
    the slave(peripheral) sending a message. The slave process the 
    message and returns an answer.

    The class uses the serial port to implement this protocol.

    :param int stopbits: Number of bits at the end of each message.

    :param float timeout: Time to wait to achieve the communication.
