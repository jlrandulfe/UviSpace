"""Multithreading routine for controlling external FPGAs with cameras.

The module creates several parallel threads, in order to optimize the 
execution time, as it contains several instructions which require 
waiting for external resources before continuing execution e.g. waiting 
for the TCP/IP client to deliver FPGA registers information. Namely, 6 
different threads are managed and indexed in a list called *threads*:

* 4 threads that run the 4 FGPAs initialization routines. Afterwards,
  endless loops continually request the UGVs' positions to each FPGA.
* Another thread that interacts with the user through keyboard. It reads
  input commands and performs corresponding actions.
* A final thread is in charge of merging the information obtained at
  each FPGA thread and obtain global UGVs' positions.

NOTE: The proper way to end the program is to press 'Q', as the terminal
prompt indicates during execution. If the Keyboard Interrupt is used 
instead, it will probably corrupt the TCP/IP socket and the FPGAs will 
have to be reset.
