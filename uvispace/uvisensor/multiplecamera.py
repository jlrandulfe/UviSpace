"""
Multithreading routine for controlling external FPGAs with cameras.

The module creates several parallel threads, in order to optimize the 
execution time, as it contains several instructions which require 
waiting for external resources before continuing execution e.g. waiting 
for the TCP/IP client to deliver FPGA registers information. Namely, 6 
different threads are started and stored in a list called *threads*:

* 4 threads contain the 4 FGPAs initialization processes and endless 
  loops are continually requesting the UGVs' positions to the FPGA.
* Another thread interacts with the user through terminal. It reads
  input commands, namely for finishing the program.
* A final thread is in charge of merging the information obtained from
  each FPGA.

NOTE: The proper way to end the program is to press 'Q', as the terminal
prompt indicates during execution. Using the Keyboard Interrupt will 
probably corrupt the TCP/IP socket and the FPGAs will have to be reset.
